What platforms and hardware does it work on?
------
- Windows 10 (or newer) / Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (or newer)
- Graphics card: GTX 1050 Ti or newer
- Memory: 4 GiB RAM or more

Build Requirements
------
- ~60 GiB of disk space
- CMake 3.21.4 or newer
- Python 3.9.5 or newer

###### Windows
- Visual Studio 2022 or newer

###### Linux
- clang-14 or newer (Pragma is *not* compatible with gcc!)

Build Instructions
------
To build Pragma, all you have to do is run the following command from a command-line interface:
```console
git clone https://github.com/Silverlan/pragma.git --recurse-submodules && cd pragma && python build_scripts/build.py --with-pfm --with-all-pfm-modules --with-vr
```

This will clone Pragma and run the build-script, which will automatically download all dependencies, configure CMake, and build and install the project (this will take several hours).
If you don't need the filmmaker, you can omit the `--with-pfm --with-all-pfm-modules` arguments, which will reduce the build time and the required amount of disk space.
> :warning: Linux<br/>
> Do **not** run the script as superuser.<br/>
> The script will automatically install all required system packages. Since this requires admin priviliges, you may be prompted for your password several times.<br/>
> You can disable confirmation prompts (e.g. for automated builds) by adding the `--no-confirm` argument, however entering your password may still be required.
<br/>

Once the build script has been completed, you should find the build files in `pragma/build`, and the install files in `pragma/build/install`. The `install` directory should contain everything you need to run Pragma.

If you make any code changes to the core engine code, you can build the `pragma-install` target to build them. This will also re-install the binaries.

If you make any code changes to a module, you will have to build the module build target first, and then build `pragma-install` afterwards.

After the initial run of the main build script, you can run the following command from the root directory of Pragma to update Pragma to a newer version:
```console
python build_scripts/build.py --update
```
This will pull all of the latest changes for the Pragma repository and the modules. The `--update` option will re-use all of the arguments used in the last execution of the build script, so you don't have to specify them again.

### Build Customization

Running the build-script with the arguments above will build and install Pragma and the Pragma Filmmaker with all dependencies. Alternatively you can also configure the build to your liking with the following parameters:

Modules
------
If you want to add functionality to Pragma without changing the core source code, you can do so by creating a custom binary module. The setup for this is very simple and only takes a few minutes. For more information, please check out the [wiki article](https://wiki.pragma-engine.com/books/pragma-engine/page/binary-modules#bkmrk-custom-modules).

There are also various pre-made binary modules available for Pragma, some of which are already included with this repository, and some of which can be found online:
> :warning: Some of these modules have not been maintained and may no longer be compatible with the latest version of Pragma.

To build a module, simply run the build-script with the following parameter:
```console
--module <moduleName>:<gitUrl>
```

The build script will clone, build and install the module automatically.

If you only want to install a module without building it, you can also run the following console command from within Pragma to download and install the module automatically:
```console
install_module <githubModuleName> [<version>]
```
The `githubModuleName` consists of the GitHub username and the repository name.
If no version is specified, the latest release binaries will be used.

Example:
```console
install_module Silverlan/pr_curl
```

Addons
------
In addition to binary modules, Pragma also uses Lua as scripting language, with thousands of available function, class and library bindings. To get more information about the Lua API, check out the [official wiki](https://wiki.pragma-engine.com/books/lua-api).
An example for a Lua-addon is the [Pragma Filmmaker](https://github.com/Silverlan/pfm).
